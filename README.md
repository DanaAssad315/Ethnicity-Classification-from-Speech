Speech-Based Ethnicity Classification System

Project Description: 
This project aims to develop a speech-based ethnicity classification system that identifies a speakerâ€™s ethnicity from a short speech segment. The system leverages machine learning models and audio feature extraction techniques to analyze speech patterns and classify speakers based on their ethnicity.

1. System Functionalities
The ethnicity classification system includes the following functionalities:

  Feature Extraction: Extract acoustic and linguistic features from speech segments.
  Model Training: Train machine learning models using extracted features from training data.
  Ethnicity Classification: Classify speech segments into one of the predefined ethnic groups.
  Performance Evaluation: Assess system performance using accuracy and other evaluation metrics on testing data.

2. Dataset
The system requires speech datasets (.wav files) for training and testing:
